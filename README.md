[NPM](https://npmjs.com/package/iconnectivity-js)

This library allows you to communicate with
[iConnectivity](https://iconnectivity.com) devices using JS and the
[Web MIDI API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_MIDI_API).
It is still in very early development, but the basics already work.

The library's goal is to provide an abstraction layer that allows access to all
methods described in the
[Common System Exclusive Commands](https://downloads.iconnectivity.com/manuals/iConnectivitySYSEXCmds.pdf)
document.

## Getting Started
